Recap from Week 1: Counting Principles

e@ Last week, we established the groundwork for quantifying possibilities.

We learned:

e Product Rule: When multiple independent tasks are performed in
sequence, the total number of ways is the product of the ways for each
task. E.g., choosing a shirt AND pants.

Sum Rule: When a task can be performed in one of several mutually
exclusive ways, the total number of ways is the sum of the ways for
each alternative. E.g., choosing a math course OR a CS course.
Permutations: Arrangements of objects where the order of selection is
crucial. E.g., awarding gold, silver, bronze medals. Formula:

P(n, k) = C=

e Combinations: Selections of objects where the order does NOT

matter. E.g., forming a committee. Formula: C(n,k) = (2) = =a

Recap from Week 1: Counting Principles

@ These counting principles are indispensable for determining the size of
the sample space (||) and the number of outcomes in an event
(|E|), which are the building blocks for classical probability.

@ Today, we transition from “how many ways’ to “how likely” —
introducing the formal framework of probability.

What is Probability? (Intuitive Understanding)

@ Probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood or chance that a
specific event will occur.

e It is always a value between 0 and 1, inclusive.

@ A probability of 0 (P(E) = 0) indicates that the event E is impossible
and will never occur.

@ A probability of 1 (P(E) = 1) indicates that the event E is certain to
occur.

@ Values between 0 and 1 represent varying degrees of likelihood.

@ Probabilities are often expressed as fractions (e.g., 1/2), decimals
(e.g., 0.5), or percentages (e.g., 50%).

Classical Definition of Probability

@ The Classical Definition of probability applies when all outcomes in
the sample space are equally likely.

e If an experiment has a finite sample space 2 with equally likely
outcomes, and an event E C Q), then the probability of event E is:

P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes for E _ [E|
Total number of possible outcomes —|Q)|
e@ Example: Rolling a fair six-sided die.

e Sample Space 2 = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, so |Q| = 6.

e Event E = {rolling an even number} = {2,4, 6}, so |E| = 3.

e P(E) = fet = 3 = 3-

e This definition is intuitive for simple, symmetric experiments.

Limitations of the Classical Definition

@ The classical definition relies heavily on the assumption of " equally
likely outcomes” .

e Problem: What if outcomes are not equally likely? (e.g., a biased coin
where heads is more likely than tails). The formula |E|/|Q| would not
apply directly.

@ It struggles with situations involving infinite sample spaces.

e Problem: What is the probability of choosing exactly 0.5 from all real
numbers between 0 and 1? The "number of outcomes’ becomes
ill-defined.

@ It doesn't provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for deriving
more complex probability rules and theorems.

@ To overcome these limitations and build a universal framework, we
turn to the axiomatic approach.

Axiomatic Approach to Probability (Kolmogorov, 1933)

e@ Andrey Kolmogorov introduced an axiomatic framework for

probability.
@ Probability is defined through three fundamental axioms.

@ These axioms guarantee mathematical consistency and provide the
basis for all probability theorems.

Axiom 1: Non-negativity

e@ Statement: For any event E € fF,
PCE) = 0

e@ Meaning: Probabilities cannot be negative.

e@ Example: Rolling a 7 on a standard die: P({7}) = 0, never negative.

Axiom 2: Normalization

e@ Statement: The probability of the entire sample space is 1:
PQ) = 1

e@ Meaning: When an experiment is performed, some outcome in 2
must occur.

@ Example: Rolling a die always gives some face {1, 2,3, 4,5,6}, so the
total probability is 1.

Axiom 3: Countable Additivity

e@ Statement: For any sequence of pairwise disjoint events

Ey, Bo, --- EF, . .
P( Ue) = 5 P(E)
i=1 si

e Meaning: If events cannot happen together, the probability of “any
of them happening” is the sum of their probabilities.

e Example: On a die, P({2}U {4}) = P({2}) + P({4}) =2 42 =}.

Definition 1.1: Probability Space

A probability space is a triplet (02,7, P), where:
@ 2: the sample space, the set of all possible outcomes.
e F: a collection of events (subsets of (2).

e@ P: the probability measure, a function assigning probabilities to
events in F.

Yutong Zhao Stochastic Computing


--- Page 12 ---
Definition 1.2: Probability Function

A probability function is a map P: F — R satisfying:
e@ Non-negativity: P(E) > 0 for all Ee F.
e@ Normalization: P(Q) = 1.
e@ Countable additivity: For any disjoint E,, Eo,...,

AU E\) = >> PCE).

Remarks (Discrete Probability Spaces)

@ In many cases we use discrete spaces: (2 is finite or countably
infinite, and F is often all subsets of 2.

@ In such cases, P is uniquely determined by the probabilities of the
simple (elementary) events in 2.

Lemma 1.1: Two-Event Union

Statement. For any £;, fo € F,
P(E, U E>) = P(E,) + P(E2) — P(E, M E>).

Idea. When we sum P(E£;) and P(Ez), we are adding the probabilities of
all outcomes in F, and all outcomes in E>. Any outcome in the
intersection (E, M E2) gets its probability counted twice. To correct this,
we must subtract the probability of the intersection once.

Use. Corrects the double-counting of the intersection.

Lemma 1.2: Union Bound

Statement. For any finite or countable collection of events

Fy, Bo,--- EF,
P(UE) < 30 P(6).

Use. Provides a simple upper bound on the probability of a union, even
when events are not disjoint.

Example. For events EF; = {rain}, Es = {snow}:

P(rain or snow) < P(rain) + P(snow).

Lemma 1.3: Inclusion—Exclusion Principle

Statement. For any n events £;,...,E, € F,
P(Ue) =>5P()- SS P(E)
i=1 i=1 1<i<j<n

+ So P(EINE OE)

Use. Gives the exact probability of a union by alternating signs to correct
for over-counting.

Definition 1.3: Independence of Two Events

Definition. Two events E, F € F are independent if and only if
PIEN FF) — PCE) « Pe).

Intuition. The occurrence of E does not affect the probability of F, and
vice versa. Knowing that one event happened gives no extra information
about the other.
Example.
e Tossing two fair coins:
E = {first coin is heads}, F = {second coin is heads}. Then
P(E) = P(F)=% and PQPENF)=5%=5°5. => Eand F are
independent.

Definition 1.4: Mutual Independence

Definition. A collection of events Fi, Fo,..., FE, € F are mutually
independent if for every subset {E;,, E;,,..., &;, } (with 1< k <n),

Pie M Ey M.A FE.) = PCE: ) . PUE) tee P(E; )

Intuition. Not only are events independent in pairs, but every group of
them behaves independently.
Example.

@ Tossing three fair coins. Let E; = {coin 1 is heads},

E> = {coin 2 is heads}, E3 = {coin 3 is heads}. Then for any subset
(pairs or all three together), the independence condition holds.

Axioms of Probability: Example 1 - Rolling a Die

Rolling a Fair Six-Sided Die

Experiment: roll a fair die. Sample space: Q = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, each
outcome has probability 1/6.

Check Axiom 1 (Non-negativity): For any x € 2, P({x}) =1/6>0.
Thus, for any event E C 9, P(E) > 0.

Checking Axiom 3 (Additivity)

Let E, = {2,4,6} (even), Ep = {1,3,5} (odd). They are disjoint:
FE M E, = 0, and

P(E:) =3/6=1/2, P(E) = 3/6 =1/2.
Then

P(E, U Ep) = P(E,) + P(E) = 1/2+1/2=1= P(Q).
Additivity holds.
